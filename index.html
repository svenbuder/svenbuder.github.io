									<h2>I answer fundamental questions with starlight!</h2>
									<center>
										<h4>The history of our cosmos is written in the starlight!<br></h4>
										I use starlight when hunting for the lost pages of the Milky Way's formation history (Galactic Archaeology), to understand how stars evolve (Stellar Physics), and how stars create the elements of our periodic table (Origin of the Elements), and even how stars influence the environment of planets that live outside of our Solar system (exoplanets). <br><br>
										<h4>To extract starlight, I develop Galactic barcode scanners!<br></h4>
										Splitting the starlight into its wavelength as stellar spectra - like a stellar rainbow - allows us to measure element absorption lines like "barcodes".
										I use state-of-the-art modelling and develop pipelines to extract the chemical composition of elements of stars from these barcodes.<br><br>
										<h4>A spectrum says more than a 1000 pictures!<br></h4>
										Through my work, I have become one the leader of Australia's flagship survey for stellar spectroscopy, the "Galactic Archaeologist with HERMES" (GALAH) Survey, and am strongly involved in other spectroscopic surveys that will observe tens of millions of stars (l4MOST Survey) or take ground-breaking observations of edge-on spiral galaxies to compare their history with the Milky Way's (GECKOS Survey). <br><br>

												<h4>Galactic Archaeology</h4>
												<p>Galactic archaeology addresses three key questions of astrophysics, identified in the current decadal plan of Australian astronomy (2016-2025), through observations of stars as galactic “fossils” in our Milky Way: When, where, and how are stars born? How do galaxies form and evolve? What is the origin of the elements?</p>

												<p>GALAH is a survey that aims to explore the chemical information of stars in our Milky Way. Can we trace back stars that have been born together via their chemical composition? How much did the Galaxy 'self-pollute' itself chemically? How much formation memory is saved or lost? In the framework of Galactic Archaeology we try to address these questions with <a href="http://www.galah-survey.org">The GALAH survey</a>.</p>

									<h2>My Impact and Publications</h2>
									Since the commencement of my PhD in 2015, I have developed a wide network of collaborations on a national and international scale by joining existing collaborations and initiating them myself. Within Australia, I have been well connected since 2015 through my work in the Australian-led GALAH collaboration and since 2019 through the ARC Centre of Excellence for All Sky Astrophysics in 3 Dimensions (ASTRO 3D). I am regarded as one of the most competitive and high-performing early-career researchers in Australian astronomy less than five years post-PhD (Pimbblet 2011), as can be exemplified by the following key numbers:<br><br>

									<h2>About me</h2>
																				<h3>Academic Summary</h3>
										<p>Sven Buder is a Galactic archaeologist and stellar astrophysicist: He uses the light of stars to explore their chemical enrichment. He uses the chemical patterns in combination with the ages, and orbits of stars in our Milky Way to explain its evolution. He got his PhD in 2019 at the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy in Heidelberg for his work on combining stellar orbit information from the Gaia satellite with high-resolution stellar spectra from the Galactic Archaeology with HERMES Survey. As Fellow at the Australian National University, he is leading the GALAH Survey in its second phase to reach 1 million spectra and uses the data to assess how different populations of the Milky Way formed and what impact events like major mergers had on their shape.
